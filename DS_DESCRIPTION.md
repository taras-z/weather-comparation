# Data sources

All data downloaded from [Iowa State University ASOS Archive](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml).


The value 'M'. represents either value that was reported as missing or a value that was set to missing after meeting some general quality control check, or a value that was never reported by the sensor. The METAR format makes it difficult to determine which of the three cases may have happened.
